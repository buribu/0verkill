If you have OS/2, please read README.OS2 instead of this file.

Requirements
------------

To run 0verkill you must have:

    * Linux computer
    * GNU make
    * GCC
    * text mode or Xwindow system with libX11 and libXpm


Installation and running
------------------------

    * download the source code from http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~brain/0verkill/release/0verkill.tgz

    * type "tar xvfz 0verkill.tgz"
   
    * enter the 0verkill directory
   
    * type "configure" or "configure --with-x" if you have Xwindow
   
    * if you want to disable 3D support (it's enabled by default), edit cfg.h
      file and comment out line "#define TRI_D" (just at the beginning of the
      file)

    * then type "make" to compile binaries
   
    * type "server" to start server, or "server -p <port number>" to determine 
      port number (default port is 6666)
     
    * to join the game type "0verkill" or "0verkill -s <xsize>x<ysize>" to 
      explicitely set picture size (in characters)
     
    * if you're running X type "x0verkill" or
      "x0verkill [-d <display>] [-f <font>]" 

    * if you want to see the game in 3D, supply "-3" option on the command
      line. To learn more about 3D 0verkill, read "3d.txt" file in the "doc"
      directory.
   
    * select server address and port, your color and name
   
    * to learn which keys to use for playing press the H key (it toggles help -
      even in the game) 

    * press ENTER and enjoy!

    * if you want to rebuild 0verkill completely, run the "rebuild" script


Problems and Solutions
----------------------
    
    * when x0verkill writes "Can't load font ..." and you want to set your own
      default font (not to write "-f <font>" argument everytime you run
      x0verkill) edit cfg.h file and change DEFAULT_FONT_NAME to your font name

    * if keyboard response is bad in X make you're probably running 0verkill
      instead of x0verkill
