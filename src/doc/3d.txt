How to run it
=============

If you want to run 0verkill with 3D support, add "-3" option behind "0verkill"
or "x0verkill" command. The screen will be divided into two parts or in
x0verkill there will be two windows.


3D looking
==========

Crosseyed viewing
-----------------

Put the window 0verkill to the left and 0verkill3d to the right. They must be
in the same height and near to each other (the nearer the better). Then cross
your eyes as if you were looking onto something that is very near. You will
see many images and adjust your eyes until the left and right window fit
exactly onto each other (when both window titles join into one). Then you will
see 3d image.

Parallel viewing
----------------

Parallel viewing is possible only when your windows are less distant than your
eyes. Parallel viewing makes better 3d feeling. Put the 0verkill3d vindow left
and 0verkill right, also in the same distance. Then look into very deep into
the monitor until both images form one 3d image.


Notice
======

This is rather experimental feature, I don't think it's possible to play the
game in 3D mode for longer time because of eye-straining. Especially when
you're not well trained. Nobody is able to stare at a 3D picture for hours :-)
