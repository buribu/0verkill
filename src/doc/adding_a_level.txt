How to add a level
------------------
Let's suppose you want to add level with name "new_level". This is a cookbook
how to create it.

1) Edit data/level.dat file and append a new line with string "new_level".
   Remember number of the added line (starting from 0). Let's suppose it's X.

2) Touch files:
	data/new_level.sp
	data/new_level.dn
	data/new_level.st

3) Add all graphics you want to the data/new_level.sp file.

4) Run "editor -lX", where X is from (1). Edit the level. Don't forget to
create some birthplaces.

5) If you want to create some cool new graphics, run 
   "avi grx/graphics_file.avi". Then add it to the data/new_level.sp

6) When the level is done, run "server -lX", where X is again from (1). And
   play!
