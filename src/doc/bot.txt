Reaperbot for 0verkill
----------------------

Each bot is a standalone program communicating with the server over the net.
Bots don't have very high IQ at this moment. They move accidentally around and
when they see player, they haunt him and shoot. If you want to improve them
I'll appreciate it.

To run reaperbot, type: bot -a <server address> [ -p <port> ]
